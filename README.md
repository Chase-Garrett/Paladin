## Description
Hybrid cryptosystem making use of AES-CBC and RSA.

## Installation and Usage
Clone the repository and run from terminal with python main.py. This was developed with python3.12
and is not tested on earlier versions of python.

Running the program will display a window where you can enter the plain text you want to encrypt.
Once you have entered the message you would like to encrypt click one of the AES encryption keys on the
left side of the window based on the level of encryption you want.

The encrypted message will be displayed in another text box as will the RSA encrypted AES key. You can now
click the decrypt button and the plain text box will be deleted and then filled with the decrypted text.
You can better observe the decryption if you choose to manually delete the plain text box prior to decryption.
